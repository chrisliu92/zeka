                        <p>Make Your Guess: Start by entering a valid 5-letter word from the dictionary. After typing your guess, press Enter to submit it. The colors of the letters will provide feedback on your attempt.</p>
                        <p>Understanding Color Feedback:</p>
                        <p>Green: Indicates that the letter is both in the word and in the correct position.</p>
                        <p>Yellow: Signifies that the letter is in the word but located in the wrong position.</p>
                        <p>Gray: Means the letter is not present in the word at all. </p>
                        <p>Helpful Strategies: To maximize your chances of success, consider starting with a word that includes multiple vowels. Many players recommend beginning with words like "IRATE" or "ARISE" for better insights.</p>
                        <p>Correcting Your Guesses: If you need to remove a letter, simply use the backspace key. Keep in mind that your guess must be a legitimate word; otherwise, you will receive an alert.</p>
                       <p>Winning the Game: When you guess the correct word, a popup will appear showing your statistics. You can choose to share your results with friends or opt to play again!</p>

Simply enter your guesses and click on the letters to change their colors, just like in the game. These tools suggest potential words based on your inputs, narrowing down the possibilities.

                            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why has Wordle become so popular?</h3>
                            <p class="text-gray-700">The original game featured a single word for all players to guess within a 24-hour period, fostering a sense of community. Players loved sharing their results on social media, showcasing their guessing skills through colored grids. This unique sharing format became a badge of honor, contributing to the game's viral success.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-700">Currently, there is no multiplayer option available for Wordle. However, you can still enjoy the game solo and compare your results with friends afterward!</p>
